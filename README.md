# 🚖 Dynamic Pricing in Ride-Hailing Services

Dynamic pricing is a critical strategy in ride-hailing platforms like Uber, Lyft, and Ola. This project analyzes **factors influencing ride costs** and builds a foundation for **dynamic pricing models** based on supply-demand, customer behavior, and ride characteristics.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset captures key aspects of ride-hailing dynamics:

| Feature                        | Description                              |

| **Location\_Category**         | Urban, Suburban, or Rural                |
| **Customer\_Loyalty\_Status**  | Silver, Regular, etc.                    |
| **Number\_of\_Past\_Rides**    | Ride history of a customer               |
| **Average\_Ratings**           | Customer’s average rating                |
| **Time\_of\_Booking**          | Night, Evening, Afternoon                |
| **Vehicle\_Type**              | Economy / Premium                        |
| **Expected\_Ride\_Duration**   | Estimated duration of the ride (minutes) |
| **Historical\_Cost\_of\_Ride** | Historical ride cost in currency units   |

Would you like me to also add a **workflow diagram (PNG/Markdown flowchart)** showing how data flows → preprocessing → analysis → dynamic pricing model, so your README looks more professional and visually engaging?
